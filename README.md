# Code Hangman

Code Hangman is a fun and interactive word guessing game built with React.js. Test your knowledge of programming-related words while enjoying a classic hangman experience with a modern twist.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the game:** The game will start automatically when you open the page.
2.  **Guess a letter:** Use the on-screen keyboard to guess a letter.
3.  **Correct guess:** If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
4.  **Incorrect guess:** If the letter is not in the word, one of the programming languages will "die" (gray out).
5.  **Win the game:** You win by guessing the word before making 8 mistakes.
6.  **Lose the game:** You lose if you make 8 mistakes before guessing the word.

## Project Overview

In Code Hangman, the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. With each incorrect guess, a programming language "dies" (grays out). The player wins by guessing the word before making 8 mistakes.

This project showcases a clean and responsive user interface, smooth animations, and a polished user experience. It's a great example of a simple yet engaging game built with modern web technologies.
